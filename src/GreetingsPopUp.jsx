              Welcome to the React Tic Tac Toe App! This is a two-player game
              where players take turns clicking on the squares of the board to
              place their corresponding "X" or "O". The objective is to be the
              first to get three of your marks in a rowâ€”whether horizontally,
              vertically, or diagonally. If all squares are filled without a
              winner, the game results in a tie. As you play, the game
              dynamically updates to show each player's moves, and the winner
              (or tie) is determined automatically. Once a game ends, you can
              start a new round by resetting the board. Enjoy playing and
              challenging your opponent in this classic game!
